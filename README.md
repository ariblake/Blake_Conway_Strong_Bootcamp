# Matchstick Advertising and Marketing Agency
This project was built for an assignment for Fanshawe College. In groups of 3, we were to create, brand and build a fictional startup agency. After brainstorming, the name Matchstick came to the surface. This name described our mission statement words perfectly; we are passionate about our work, find the latest trends and overall, we are hot :fire:
