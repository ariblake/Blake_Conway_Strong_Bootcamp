# Matchstick - Spark Creativity
This project was built for an assignment for Fanshawe College. In groups of 3, we were to create, brand and build a fictional startup agency. After brainstorming, the name Matchstick was born. Matchstick is an advertising and marketing agency located in London, Ontario. This name described our mission statement words perfectly; we are passionate about our work, we strive to find the latest brand and marketing trends and overall, we are hot :fire:
